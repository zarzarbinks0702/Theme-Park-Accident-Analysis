At the time, patron was holding onto the lap bar.When the lap bar came loose, patron positioned his feet to secure himself in the seat. As the boat passed the fencing, the lap bar caught the fence on the platform. This motion pinched his right forearm between the wrist and elbow on the underside of his arm. Patron was taken to the 'Guest Relations' office where ice was administered, and this report was taken. As per ride operator, Rafal Bury, the patron and another passenger were sitting on opposite sides of the boat in the end seats. Rafal said patron was yelling and gripping the lap bar tight. When the lap bar came out, Rafal removed his foot from the 'dead-man' pedal and pressed the 'emergency break' button. As per Assistant Manager, Daniel Sierra, who witnessed the incident, the patron was riding in row #1 on the 'Pharaoh's Fury' ride. Patron was clutching his lap bar as the ride began to run its cycle (Swinging side to side). The ride was in its beginning stage and not making a full swing. His lap bar appeared to pop out on the left side. patron continued to hold onto the lap bar, causing it to become positioned perpendicular from its normal position. Daniel then witnessed the operator disengage the 'Dead-Man' switch. Patron was standing in his seat holding onto the lap bar. The lap bar moved around from the left side of the boat to the outside of the right side.
